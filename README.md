# casper Zebrafish versus Mycobacterium tuberculosis GC Composition Percentage Comparison

## Introduction
In this research project, I aim to compare the guanine-cytosine (GC) composition percentages between casper Zebrafish and H37RV Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The GC composition is an essential genomic characteristic that can provide insights into the genetic makeup and evolution of organisms. By comparing the GC composition percentages of these two species, I can gain a better understanding identifying regions of genomic variation.

## Dataset Description
For my analysis, I utilized genomic sequences obtained from public databases. The Zebrafish genomic sequences were retrieved from [Database of Zebrafish Genomic Resources](https://zebrafish.org/genome/databases/), while the Mycobacterium tuberculosis sequences were obtained from [TBDB - The Tuberculosis Database](https://www.tbdb.org/). I performed necessary preprocessing steps, including quality control and filtering, to ensure the reliability and consistency of the data.

## Data Analysis and Visualization
### Data Preparation
To calculate the GC composition percentage, I employed computational methods to analyze the genomic sequences. I utilized tools such as [Biopython](https://biopython.org/) and custom scripts to extract the GC content from the DNA sequences. The resulting GC composition percentages were then used for further analysis and comparison.

### Data Comparison
To compare the GC composition percentages between Zebrafish and Mycobacterium tuberculosis, I employed statistical analysis techniques. I conducted a t-test to determine if there are significant differences in the GC composition between the two species. Additionally, I performed an ANOVA analysis to explore potential variations across different strains or subspecies of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

### Data Visualization
To present my findings, I employed various data visualization tools. I utilized Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn to create visually appealing plots. I generated bar charts, box plots, and scatter plots to illustrate the differences in the GC composition percentages between Zebrafish and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. These visualizations help in understanding the distribution and variation of GC composition in the two species.

## Expected Results
Based on previous studies, I anticipate observing differences in the GC composition percentages between Zebrafish and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Zebrafish is a vertebrate organism with a relatively higher GC content compared to Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which is a bacterial pathogen known for its low GC content. I expect to see statistically significant variations that reflect the distinct genomic characteristics of these two organisms.

## Instructions to Reproduce
To reproduce my analysis and visualizations, follow these steps:
1. Install Python (version X.X.X) and the required libraries listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
2. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git`

## Conclusion
Through my research, I aim to provide insights into the GC composition differences between Zebrafish and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. By comparing the GC percentages, I can gain a better understanding of their genetic characteristics and potential evolutionary implications. These findings may contribute to the broader field of genomics and aid in future studies of these organisms.
